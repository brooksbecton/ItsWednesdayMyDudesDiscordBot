Bot that will tell a channel that it is Wednesday and will link a "It's Wednesday my dudes" meme

## Setup

You will need an .env file in the root of the project with structure like

```env
token="YOUR_DISCORD_TOKEN"
botname="YOUR_BOTS_NAME"
youtubeApiKey="YOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY"
```

### API Key Links

* [How to get a Discord token](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token)
* [How to get a Youtube API key](https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application#Create_API_Keys)


### Timezone Note

NodeJS gets time from the server it is running on. So if you want an accurate Wednesday announcement, you must configure the server time to match the audience's time. 


## Functionality

* Listens for "_my dude_" and
  * "_wednesday_" and will tell you if it is Wednesday
  * "_video_" and will post a frog meme video
* Listens for "_ping_" and will reply with "_pong_", by popular demand
